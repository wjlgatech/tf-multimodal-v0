The info from col with narrow emb_width can be overwhelmed by the col with wide emb_width. **Solution**: instead of using simple concat, to add a `deep-wide module` where the deep layer squeeze the cols with dense representation (e.g. embedding with 16 cols) while the wide layer is to process the sparse cols. Then the output from deep-branch and the output from the wide-branch is combined. In this way, features of various embedding width are normalized so that their contribution can be backtracked and compared.\n",
